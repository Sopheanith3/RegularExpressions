Sopheanith Ny - Individual Assignment - Regular Expressions

Overview/Shortcoming:

This project implements regular expression to validate various types of information. 
Throghtout this project I have collaborate with Lwazi and I have used two of his test are the password test 
and the containing the odd numbers. For the extra credit I have complete all the extra credit as you can see in the pdf that 
I have attached it. 

The shortcoming thorughtout this project is that I am struggling with getting the password the most where I didn't 
get the strong password to pass (e.g. Secure!Pass@12). The way I fixed it I add a regex where it prevent two two duplicate characters. 
Overall, everything is good now and fix. 

Extra Credit: 
1. SSN - 2 points Extra credit if you make sure the SSN is allowable based on numbering rules by the Social Security Administration
2. Phone Number - 2 points Extra credit if you allow only official area codes
3. City - 2 points extra credit if you make sure the 2 character state abbreviation (e.g. WA) is valid
